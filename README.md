# PyBer_Analysis
Pyber analysis was completed in Jupyter Notebook.

## Purpose
The purpose for the analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the provided ride-sharing data by city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. The final analysis showed the weekly fares by city type using a line graph.

## Results

The table below shows the Pyber summary DataFrame had the following:
  - Rural city types had the lowest Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares, but the highest Average Fare per Ride and Driver.
  - Suburban city types were in the middle for all categories listed in the summary.
  - Urban city types had the highest Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares, but the lowest Average Fare per Ride and Driver.

The PyBer Fare Summary Chart analyzed total fares by city type per week. The month of February had peaks for all city types. March showed dips in total fares by city type. The line graph below reflects the peeks and dips from January 2019 - April 2019.

## Summary
Recommendations to improve the disparities among the city types are the following:
1. Investigate why the average fare per driver in the Rural cities is $55.49.
2. Use established methods in the Urban cities and implement the methods in the Suburban and Rural cities. 
3. Find incentives for more ride sharing in the months of January and March.
